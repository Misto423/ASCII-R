ASCII-R
=======

An ascii rougelike/rpg in c# console.

Created using only C# functions - no external libraries, frameworks, or tools.

Mostly finished.  The maze is randomized and divided into 16 zones, with difficulty increasing the further you progress through the maze.
There may be a few minor bugs, but I haven't touched this in a long time.  Feel free to contact me if you find any though.
